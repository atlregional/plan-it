## Proposing Changes to Projects
If you'd like to propose a change to a particular project, here's how you can go about that process:

1. Log in to GitHub. (If you haven't already, create a GitHub account -- this is free and easy to do.)
2. Find the project for which you would like to propose a change.
3. Create a new issue making detailed reference to the particular project and line item as well as whatever field needs to change (and what the new value should be).
4. Label the issue accordingly (choosing from one of the labels).
5. Sit back and wait for someone at ARC to receive your proposal.  We'll do our best to act on your issue as soon as possible.  The more detail you provide, the quicker we can respond.

## Example
Here's an example of a [well-created issue](https://github.com/atlregional/plan-it/issues/8).

The creator linked to a specific project (and line) and provided sufficient detail to make the change.
