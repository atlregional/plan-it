plan-it
=======

Demo of how GitHub can be used as transparent project management tool for state, regional, or local governments.

Data
=======

The data here were imported from a report made with the Atlanta Regional Commission [Plan-It project database](http://planitpublic.atlantaregional.com/).  The seed data is from the TIP 13Q3 modification period and contains all projects within the City of Atlanta jurisdiction.

## Viewing the Data

The data formats used here (csv, geoJSON) are [both natively](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data) [supported by GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github), that is you can view them as tables or maps just by clicking on the file name.

### Examples

map: https://github.com/landonreed/plan-it/blob/gh-pages/data/rtp_all.geojson

table: https://github.com/landonreed/plan-it/blob/gh-pages/data/TIP/projects.csv

## Contributing

If there is something wrong with the data you see here, feel free to edit (either locally on your own computer or directly on GitHub).  By [using a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) or the [issue tracking system](https://github.com/features/projects/issues), you'll let us know that something needs to change here and we'll address it as soon as we can.

For an easy way to edit geoJSON in the browser, check out http://geojson.io/

A super easy way to work with csv on Windows is with [notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and the [TextFX plugin](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12699833/textfx-menu-is-missing-in-notepad).  You can [line up multiple lines by commas](http://superuser.com/questions/120488/converting-csv-to-fixed-width-in-notepad), making for a very readable csv!

There also seem to be [some great plugins](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331211/sublime-text-2-alignment-of-comma-separated-values) available for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).
