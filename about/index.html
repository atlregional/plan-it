<h1>About</h1>
	<p>This site was built in response to a few "trends" that we think have lasting impacts on the way we manage data and software.</p>
	<div class="col-md-4">
		<h4>Trend 1: Open Data</h4>
	<p>Government is for the people, so why shouldn't the data it produces be likewise?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">
	<h4>Trend 2: Open Source</h4>
	<p>Since its genesis only a few short years ago, open source software has been transforming the software development industry.  Open source software makes all the more sense in the world of government when there are hundreds of agencies around the country (the world, even) doing very similar things.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">
	<h4>Trend 3: GitHub</h4>
	
	<p>Hosting source code on GitHub is old hat.  However, there are some very interesting use cases developing for <a href="http://government.github.com/">hosting data on GitHub</a>, especially for government.  We think TIP data and the process that surrounds it is one of those use cases.</p>
